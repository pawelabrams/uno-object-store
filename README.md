# Uno Object Store
A brutally simple quasi-functional object store. Don't @ me.

When you need a dead-simple API mock or an unprotected object store.

I needed one for my async-saving local notepad, 'cause my OS keeps running out of resources.
You might need it for a really fast mock of that app you're so deadline-pushed.

One day wind may bring middleware support. Until then, keep it away from public access!
